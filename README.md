The book consists of 9 chapters 

* **Introduction to Map-Reduce** - 
Introduction to Hadoop, Map Reduce, Pipelining, Cascading, Pig and Hive.
Chapter presents benefits of higher level abstractions of Map Reduce (concepts and capabilities).

* **Get ready for Scalding** -
Theory about Scalding - the Scala Domain Specific Language utilising Cascading. 
Development environment setup including local hadoop cluster for development.
Execute the first `Hello World` Scalding example.

* **Scalding by example** -
The core capabilities of scalding: i) Map-like functions, ii) Grouping/reducing functions iii) Join operations 

* **Intermediate examples** -
A Scalding log processing flow for a News company, aggregating multiple sources will be presented. 
Through an example with multiple pipe-lines some more advanced concepts are presented.

* **Scalding Design Patterns** -
Interesting design patterns applicable to Scalding data processing applications. Using the 'External Operations' patters will enable us performing unit testing and structuring our applications in a modular way. 
 
* **Testing & TDD** -
Best practices of first defining behaviour (_Behaviour Driven Development_) then tests (_Test Driven Development_) and then completing the implementation. How to write unit, integration tests and also apply Black-box testing methodologies in the context of Big Data.

* **Running Scalding in Production** -
Tips and tricks on how to execute and schedule jobs. Also how to co-ordinate the execution of Scalding/Scala/Java and even external system processes. Finally how to configure Scalding jobs using property files or Hadoop parameters, how to monitor and optimize jobs and other usefull tips.

* **Using external data stores** -
Interaction with external external SQL, NOSQL and in-memory applications like HBase, SQL, ElasticSearch etc.

* **Matrix Calculations and Machine Learning** - 
Matrix calculations using the Matrix API and algebird to calculate text similarity (TF-IDF) 
and set similarity (Jaccard). Then another example on Mahout K-Means clustering and outlier detection.
