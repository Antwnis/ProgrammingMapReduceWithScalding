A Scalding log processing flow for a News company, aggregating multiple sources will be presented. 
Through an example with multiple pipe-lines some more advanced concepts are presented.

Best practices of first defining behaviour (_Behaviour Driven Development_) then tests (_Test Driven Development_) before proceeding to implementation.
After implementation, functional tests and other interesting statistical testing methodologies presented.

* **Running in Production** -
Introduction to Distributed Cache and Hadoop production system deployment and execution. 
Handling multiple HDFS sources: text, avro, csv, etc. 
How to monitor and maintain cluster stability.

* **External data stores** -
Interaction with external external SQL and NOSQL data stores.
