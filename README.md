The book consists of 9 chapters 

* **Introduction to Map-Reduce** - 
Introduction to Hadoop, Map Reduce, Pipelining, Cascading, Pig and Hive.
Chapter presents benefits of higher level abstractions of Map Reduce (concepts and capabilities).

* **Get ready for Scalding** -
Theory about Scalding - the Scala Domain Specific Language utilising Cascading. 
Development environment setup including local hadoop cluster for development.
Execute the first `Hello World` Scalding example.

* **Scalding by example** -
The core capabilities of scalding: i) Map-like functions, ii) Grouping/reducing functions iii) Join operations 

* **Intermediate examples** -
A Scalding log processing flow for a News company, aggregating multiple sources will be presented. 
Through an example with multiple pipe-lines some more advanced concepts are presented.

* **Development Patterns and Best Practices** -
Presents interesting design patterns to overcome common issues and add more capabilities into Scalding.
This chapter presents the External Operations pattern, the Dependency Injection pattern and the Late Bound Dependency pattern

* **Scalding Design Patterns** -
Interesting design patterns applicable to Scalding data processing applications. Using the 'External Operations' patters will enable us performing unit testing and structuring our applications in a modular way. 
 
* **Testing & TDD** -
Best practices of first defining behaviour (_Behaviour Driven Development_) then tests (_Test Driven Development_) and then completing the implementation. How to write unit, integration tests and also apply Black-box testing methodologies in the context of Big Data.

* **Running Scalding in Production** -
Tips and tricks on how to execute and schedule jobs. Also how to co-ordinate the execution of Scalding/Scala/Java and even external system processes. Finally how to configure Scalding jobs using property files or Hadoop parameters, how to monitor and optimize jobs and other usefull tips.

* **Using external data stores** -
Interaction with external external SQL, NOSQL and in-memory applications like MemCache , Solr, ElasticSearch.
Code for accessing SQL databases 

* **Matrix Calculations and Machine Learning** - 
Machine Learning and Recommendation systems - Pattern - PMML - Mahout.
An example in Scalding for processing visits to an e-commerce site with Mahout/Pattern 
to generate recommendations and store them into a real-time no-sql database.
