{"name":"Programming Map Reduce With Scalding","tagline":"Source code for PACKT Book 'Programming Map-Reduce With Scalding'","body":"Page http://scalding-io.github.io/ProgrammingMapReduceWithScalding/\r\n\r\nThe book consists of 9 chapters \r\n\r\n* **Hadoop and Abstractions** - \r\nIntroduction to Hadoop, Map Reduce, Pipelining, Cascading, Pig and Hive.\r\nChapter presents benefits of higher level abstractions of Map Reduce (concepts and capabilities).\r\n\r\n* **Get ready for Scalding** -\r\nTheory about Scalding - the Scala Domain Specific Language utilising Cascading. \r\nDevelopment environment setup including local hadoop cluster for development.\r\nExecute the first `Hello World` Scalding example.\r\n\r\n* **Scalding reference examples** -\r\nThe core capabilities of scalding: i) Map-like functions, ii) Grouping/reducing functions iii) Join operations \r\n\r\n* **Advanced concepts-Intermediate examples** -\r\nA Scalding log processing flow for a News company, aggregating multiple sources will be presented. \r\nThrough an example with multiple pipe-lines some more advanced concepts are presented.\r\n\r\n* **Development Patterns and Best Practices** -\r\nPresents interesting design patterns to overcome common issues and add more capabilities into Scalding.\r\nThis chapter presents the External Operations pattern, the Dependency Injection pattern and the Late Bound Dependency pattern\r\n\r\n* **Testing & TDD** -\r\nBest practices of first defining behaviour (_Behaviour Driven Development_) then tests (_Test Driven Development_) and then completing the implementation. How to write unit, integration tests and also apply Black-box testing methodologies in the context of Big Data.\r\n\r\n* **Running in Production** -\r\nIntroduction to Distributed Cache and Hadoop production system deployment and execution. \r\nHandling multiple HDFS sources: text, avro, csv, etc. \r\nHow to monitor and maintain cluster stability.\r\n\r\n* **External data stores** -\r\nInteraction with external external SQL, NOSQL and in-memory applications like MemCache , Solr, ElasticSearch.\r\nCode for accessing SQL databases \r\n\r\n* **Machine Learning** - \r\nMachine Learning and Recommendation systems - Pattern - PMML - Mahout.\r\nAn example in Scalding for processing visits to an e-commerce site with Mahout/Pattern \r\nto generate recommendations and store them into a real-time no-sql database.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAntonios Antonios Chalkiopoulos (@antwnis), Stefano Galarraga (@galarragas).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
