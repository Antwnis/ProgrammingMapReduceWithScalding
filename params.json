Using the 'External Operations' patters will enable us performing unit testing and structuring our applications in a modular way. \r\n \r\n* **Testing & TDD** -\r\nBest practices of first defining behaviour (_Behaviour Driven Development_) then tests (_Test Driven Development_) and then completing the implementation. How to write unit, integration tests and also apply Black-box testing methodologies in the context of Big Data.\r\n\r\n* **Running Scalding in Production** -\r\nTips and tricks on how to execute and schedule jobs. Also how to co-ordinate the execution of Scalding/Scala/Java and even external system processes. Finally how to configure Scalding jobs using property files or Hadoop parameters, how to monitor and optimize jobs and other usefull tips.\r\n\r\n* **Using external data stores** -\r\nInteraction with external external SQL, NOSQL and in-memory applications like HBase, SQL, ElasticSearch etc.\r\n\r\n* **Matrix Calculations and Machine Learning** - \r\nMatrix calculations using the Matrix API and algebird to calculate text similarity (TF-IDF) \r\nand set similarity (Jaccard). Then another example on Mahout K-Means clustering and outlier detection.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAntonios Antonios Chalkiopoulos (@antwnis), Stefano Galarraga (@galarragas).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
